    <p>This is a <a href="https://github.com/fordsfords/semlit/tree/gh-pages">semi-literate











        document</a> for the program <tt>catchup.c</tt>.&nbsp; The <tt>catchup.c</tt>
      program illustrates the use of the "catchup" rate-setting
      algorithm.&nbsp; It is intended to teach programmers some of the
      techniques, and potentially serve as a starting-point for their
      own programs.&nbsp; Semi-literate documents like this are intended
      to explain the internals of a program, which is different than
      user documentation.<br>

    I have seen many test programs written to generate message
    traffic.&nbsp; They often are intended to allow the user to set a
    desired message rate, and they do their best to send messages at
    that rate, or at least in such a way that averages to that rate over
    time, usually a high rate (&gt; 1000 messages / second).&nbsp; The
    most common algorithm I've seen is to sleep for a short time, often
    1 millisecond, and then send in a tight loop 1/1000 of the messages
    required in a second.&nbsp; The result is a burst of messages packed
    at the start of each millisecond followed by idle for the remainder
    of that millisecond.<br>
    <br>
    One problem with this common algorithm is that different systems and
    OSes have different minimum sleep times.&nbsp; Windows often has a
    16 millisecond minimum sleep time, Solaris often has a 10
    millisecond minimum, and Linux often has a 1 millisecond
    minimum.&nbsp; Thus, the algorithm code must either be
    system-specific, or be configurable.&nbsp; Another problem with the
    common algorithm is that it often does not take into account the
    elapsed time required to send a burst of messages, making the
    resulting average rate inaccurate.&nbsp; Also, variations in system
    load can result in transient short delays in execution,&nbsp; making
    the average rate even more inaccurate.&nbsp; Also, some test
    scenarios call for traffic to be evently-spaced, not bursty.&nbsp;
    Finally, if the user requests a rate which is higher than can be
    achieved even by tight looping, most algorithms will silently be
    inaccurate.<br>
    <br>
    The catchup algorithm is self-correcting across varying systems and
    load conditions, and easily runs in a busy-looping mode which
    evenly-spaces messages even at very high rates.<br>
    <br>
    All code is written in C and uses Unix-style APIs. The reader is
    assumed to be proficient at C and have a moderate familiarity
    with&nbsp; Unix.<br>
    <p>There is one program source file:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b><span style="font-family: monospace;">=semlit,srcfile,catchup_c.slsrc,catchup.c=</span></b>
        - (right-click and save) main program.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId41959"></a>Program
      explanation: <tt>catchup.c</tt></h2>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId903022"></a>main()<br>
    </h3>
    <p>Let's start with the usage string: =semlit,insert,usage= The <tt>send_rate</tt>
      is in messages per second.&nbsp; The optional <tt>sleep_usec</tt>
      is in microseconds and defaults to zero, which means not to sleep
      (busy looping).&nbsp; For example:<br>
      <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; catchup 1000 16700</tt><br>
      This usage sends at 1000 messages/sec, with a 16.7 millisecond
      sleep, which is a common minimum sleep time on Windows.&nbsp; This
      command will nominally send a burst of 16 or 17 messages, followed
      by a 16.7 millisecond sleep.&nbsp; For this test program, the act
      of "sending a message" is simply printing a period to standard
      out.&nbsp; The program has no exit criteria; to stop the program,
      kill the process (normally with control-C).<br>
    </p>
    <p>Now let's look at the code.&nbsp; The main entry point:
      =semlit,insert,main= Nothing too surprising here.&nbsp; The
      variable <tt>e</tt> is used for Unix calls which return an error
      status (where zero means success).<br>
    </p>
    <p>The next few lines parse command-line parameters:
      =semlit,insert,parsing= If this were a user-friendly program, it
      would use standard options, which would probably involve looping
      on "<tt>getopts()</tt>" and a switch statement.&nbsp; But this
      program is intended to demonstrate the catchup algorithm, not show
      how to parse a command line in a user-friendly way.&nbsp; So the
      above code is simple ... and <a
href="http://blog.geeky-boy.com/2014/04/strtoul-preferred-over-atoi.html">inadvised</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The final bit of startup is to take a timestamp for the start of
      the program, and initialize the number of messages sent so far:
      =semlit,insert,init= The <tt>gtod64()</tt> function is local and
      is presented later.&nbsp; It returns a 64-bit number of
      microseconds since the Unix epoch (Jan 1, 1970).<br>
    </p>
    <p>Now for the main loop: =semlit,insert,loop= At the top of the
      loop, we calculate the total number of microseconds we've been
      running since the start, and then, using the desired message rate,
      calculate the total number of messages which <i>should</i> have
      been sent up to this point.&nbsp; Note that since <tt>tot_num_sent</tt>
      and <tt>should_have_sent</tt> are both <tt>long</tt>s, if you
      let the program run long enough, those variables will
      overflow.&nbsp; I neither know nor care what happens then.&nbsp;
      Feel free to make them into <tt>long long</tt>s if you want long
      running times.<br>
    </p>
    <p>=semlit,insert,burst= <tt>burst</tt> is just the number of
      messages we are behind where we should be.&nbsp; I do a quick
      check to see if we have fallen more than 1 second behind; if so
      then I consider it a fatal error and exit.&nbsp; The <tt>F()</tt>
      macro is presented later.&nbsp; I arbitrarily chose 1 second's
      worth of messages as the threshold.&nbsp; Be sure to pick a number
      which is larger than the number of messages that should be sent in
      one sleep period.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Now comes the catchup part: =semlit,insert,catchup= Send the
      burst of messages, and update the count.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Now that we should be all caught up, it's time to sleep and
      finish the main loop: =semlit,insert,sleep= The <tt>E0()</tt>
      macro checks the return status for an error; if so, it prints a
      message and exits.&nbsp; The error handling macros are presented
      later.<br>
    </p>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId173444"></a>gtod64()</h3>
    <p>The <tt>gtod64()</tt> function is simply a helper to make <tt>gettimeofday()</tt>
      easier to use by treating errors as fatal and by returning a
      single 64-bit number of microseconds since the epoch:
      =semlit,insert,gtod64= The <tt>E0()</tt> macro checks the return
      status for an error; if so, it prints a message and exits.&nbsp;
      The error handling macros are presented later.<br>
    </p>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId942055"></a>F() and E0()</h3>
    <p>Error handling code is important in terms of detecting and
      diagnosing problems, but is also costly in terms of obscuring the
      intent of the algorithm being implemented.&nbsp; Since this
      program is intended only to demonstrate the catchup algorithm, I
      didn't want any of those algorithms to be made harder to read due
      to thorough error handling, so I took a short cut:
      =semlit,insert,error= The <tt>F()</tt> macro prints a message to
      standard error along with the source file name and line number,
      and exits the program with a non-success status.&nbsp; The <tt>E0()</tt>
      macro checks the supplied status for error (non-zero), and passes
      a textual error message (<tt>strerror_r()</tt>) to <tt>F()</tt>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>These are written as macros so that the <tt>__FILE__</tt> and <tt>__LINE__</tt>
      usages in <tt>F()</tt> correspond to the location of the <i>invocations</i>
      of the macros, not where the macros are defined.<br>
    </p>
    <p>I would not expect a production program to have such user-hostile
      error reporting (you need the source file to know what failed),
      but for the purposes of a demonstration program, it's adequate.<br>
